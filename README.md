# icarus-icebox-fix-mod
Fixes the icebox glitch introduced in Patch 27

## Changes
Alters the D_TagQueries.json data file to include both Spoiled and Regular food as a target for the IceBox container.  What a very careless bug to have introduced.

## Disclaimer 

These mods are intended for **Offline** or solo play. It can potentially ruin the game for others when playing together, so please do not put yourself in that situation. If you play with a regular group and they all want it, please recommend all parties install the mod to prevent adverse effects.  Don't be a jerk.

## Installation
  
1. In Steam, right-click on Icarus in your Library, and choose `Manage` -> `Browse Local Files`
2. This will open up a folder somewhere on your disk that ends with `steamapps\common\Icarus`
3. Go into the `Icarus` folder inside there, then the `Content` folder, then the `Paks` folder.
4. Confirm that you are now in `steamapps\common\Icarus\Icarus\Content\Paks` (yes there are two Icarus in the path)
5. Create a new folder named `mods`
6. Copy the downloaded `IceBoxFix_P.pak` into the `mods` folder you created.
7. Start Icarus as normal through Steam!  You're done!
